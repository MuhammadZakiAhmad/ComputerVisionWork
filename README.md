### 1. **AI-Based Fitness Trainer: Real-time Exercise Monitoring and Repetition Counting**
- **Description:** Combining computer vision and AI, this project creates a real-time fitness trainer that uses openCV and the Mediapipe library for pose estimation. The system detects and tracks human poses during exercises, offering real-time feedback and tracking repetitions.
- **Link:** https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/AITrainer-CV-Application-.git
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, Mediapipe, Python


### 2. **Smart Car Detection and Counting System**
- **Description:** Utilizing YOLO for object detection, this project defines a Region of Interest (ROI) for vehicle counting, employs object tracking techniques, and visualizes vehicle counts in real-time.
- **Link:** https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/cvProject2_carCounterUsingYOLOv8.git
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, YOLO v8, Python

### 3. **Automatic Car Detection and License Plate Recognition System (ANPR)**
- **Description:** This project aims to develop an intelligent system for detecting vehicles and recognizing their license plates along with reading the number and logging the data using advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning models.
- **Link:** https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/ANPRUsingYOLOv8.git
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, YOLO v8, EasyOCR, SORT, Python

### 4. **Human Emotion Detection using Deep Learning**
- **Description:** This project involves training an image classifier from scratch on the Kaggle FER-2013 Dataset to detect emotions from facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces, categorized into one of seven emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
- **Link:** https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/HumanEmotionDetection.git
- **Technologies:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 5. **Digital Mannequin for Online Shops(Virtual Try On)**
- **Description:**  Developed an innovative software that creates a 3D digital model from user-uploaded photos, allowing virtual try-ons of clothing and accessories. The project features dynamic visualization of user models in motion and an extensive, customizable catalog. Enhanced personalization and customer satisfaction by providing accurate body proportion replication. Aimed at reducing return rates and improving online shopping experiences for consumers and retailers..
